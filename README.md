The repo contains dirty scripts for MD simulation and automation on the CHPC cluster.

AmberTools was used for simulation and analysis. 

The protein-ligand interactions analysis was based on a tutorial from the ProLIF (https://github.com/chemosim-lab/ProLIF).

The scripts need to be convereted into functions to make them more useable for general use.
