Title: Heating of the system slowly over 1 ns from 100K (tutorial and more reccomended)

Changes to be made: 
 - residues to be restrained (restraintmask, select all ligands, proteins and atoms) 
       - can use residue and ligand number but need to have : first i.e. ':1-532' or ':Ala' or ':WAT'
       - can use syntax i.e. @CA,C,N (backbone), WAT (water), ligand code or ! to restarin everything except anything after !. i.e. '@CA,C,N or '!@H=&:WAT,Cl-,Na+' 
       - Need to put between apostrophes.
       - Different ways to choose atoms, residues, ligands syntax at following website:
         https://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/html/amber.html  
 - residue restraint weight (restraint_wt, keep default as if not sure what it needs to be)
 - cut-off (cut) maximum is 8 unless a very small system like a single peptide.
 - change imin to 0 as we are not minimizing the system

Comments: 
- Don't start temperature at 0 as this will take a long time to heat and make the system unstable
- The tempo section at the end ensures slow heating to system to stop it from blowing up.
- ig flag is a random seed number when set to -1
- ntf needs to be 2 if ntc is 2. ntc 2 uses SHAKE
- gamma_ln represent the collision frequencyof the Langevin dynamics thermostat
- nmropt=1 tells the system to ramp heat up slowly. nmropt must = 1 for the &wt to employed
- iwrap stays 0 as autoimage by cpptraj can center and wrap waters from trajectories.
