Title: Minimizing system with only backbone restraints

Changes to be made:
 - residues to be restrained (restraintmask, select all ligands, proteins and atoms)
 - residue restraint weight (restraint_wt, keep default as if not sure what it needs to be)
 - cut-off (cut) maximum is 8 unless a very small system like a single peptide.
 - change imin to 1 as we are minimizing the system
 - same restraints on restraintmask choices using restraint_wt = 10 kcal/mol
 - Only restraining backbone with @CA, N, C 
Comments:

Command:

&cntrl
  imin = 1, maxcyc = 5000,
  ncyc = 2500, ntx = 1, 
  ntwe = 0, ntwr = 100, ntpr = 10,
  ntb = 1, ntp = 0,
  cut = 8.0,   
  ntr=1, restraintmask=":1-401@CA,N,C", restraint_wt=10.0, ! Need to add residue and ligand numbers
  ioutfm=1, ntxo=2,
