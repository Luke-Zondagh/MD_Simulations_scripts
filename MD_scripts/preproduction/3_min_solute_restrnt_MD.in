Look at tutorial 3.1 in Amber-Tutorial website. https://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial13/index.php#Minimize_the_added_water_and_ions_

Title: First minimization of solvent 
Changes to be made: 
 - residues to be restrained (restraintmask, select all ligands, proteins and atoms) 
 - residue restraint weight (restraint_wt, keep default as if not sure what it needs to be)
 - cut-off (cut) maximum is 10 unless a very small system like a single peptide.
