Title: Relaxing of the system with less backbone restrained again at 298K under constant pressure over 1 nanosecond

Changes to be made:
 - residues to be restrained (restraintmask, select all ligands, proteins and atoms)
 - residue restraint weight (restraint_wt, keep default as if not sure what it needs to be)
 - cut-off (cut) maximum is 8 unless a very small system like a single peptide.
 - change imin to 0 as we are not minimizing the system
 - reducing restraints on restraintmask choices using restraint_wt from 1 kcal/mol to 0.1 kcal/mol
 - Only restraining backbone with @CA, N, C

Comments:
 - ig flag is a random seed number when set to -1
 - ntf needs to be 2 if ntc is 2. ntc 2 uses SHAKE
 - gamma_ln represent the collision frequencyof the Langevin dynamics thermostat

Command:

 &cntrl
  imin = 0, nstlim = 1000000, dt = 0.001, ! 1 ns
  irest = 1, ntx = 5, ig = -1,
  temp0 = 298.0,
  ntc = 2, ntf = 2, tol = 0.00001,
  ntwx = 10000, ntwe = 0, ntwr = 100, ntpr = 100,
  cut = 8.0, iwrap = 0,
  ntt =3, gamma_ln=1.0, ntb = 2, ntp = 1,
  nscm = 0, barostat = 2,
  ntr=1, restraintmask=":1-401@CA,N,C", restraint_wt=0.1, ! add ligand and residue numbers
