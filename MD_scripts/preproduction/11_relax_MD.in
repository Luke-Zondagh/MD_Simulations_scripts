Title: Realxing of the system at 298K at constant pressure over 1 nansecond

Changes to be made: 
 - residues to be restrained (restraintmask, select all ligands, proteins and atoms)
 - residue restraint weight (restraint_wt, keep default as if not sure what it needs to be)
 - cut-off (cut) maximum is 8 unless a very small system like a single peptide.
 - change imin to 0 as we are not minimizing the system
 - Different ways to choose atoms, residues, ligands syntax at following website:

Comments: 
 - ig flag is a random seed number when set to -1
 - ntf needs to be 2 if ntc is 2. ntc 2 uses SHAKE
 - gamma_ln represent the collision frequencyof the Langevin dynamics thermostat
